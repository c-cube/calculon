(** {1 Plugins}

    A plugin is a bunch of commands, and optionally some disk-backed state.
    It will register its commands to the core loop *)

type action =
  | Require_reload
  (** Require that we reload everything from on-disk state *)
  | Require_save
  (** Require that the state be saved *)

and 'st stateful_ = private {
  name: string;
  (** Namespace for storing state. Must be distinct for every plugin. *)
  commands: 'st -> Command.t list;
  (** Commands parametrized by some (mutable) state, with the ability
     to trigger a signal *)
  on_msg:'st -> (Core.t -> Irc_message.t -> unit Lwt.t) list;

      initialization. *)

     It is NOT the responsibility of this command to save the state,
     as the core engine will have called {!to_json} before. *)
